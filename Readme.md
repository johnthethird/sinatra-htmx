# Sinatra HTMX

Web dev is just too damn hard. This here is a showcase of how to do things like it was 1999. Try it, you will like it.

## Sinatra

The little [framework](http://sinatrarb.com/) that could. When you just need to write a little bit of Ruby and put it on the web.

## HTMX

The star of the show, [HTMX](https://htmx.org) is a monumentally great idea. Forget Javascript sprinkles, try markup FTW.

## Tailwinds

Like chocolate and peanut butter, [CSS and HTML](https://tailwindcss.com) go great together. In fact, you can write your CSS **in** your HTML ðŸ¤¯. As a not-so-side benefit, you will **actually learn** CSS. Bonus!

## Just

Instead of Make, try out [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for your command-running needs.

Get things going with:

```bash
just dev
```

Or in Docker:

```bash
just build
just run
```
